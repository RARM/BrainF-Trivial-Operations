# BrainF Trivial Operations
This repository contains some trivial programs written in BrainF primarily for amusement, but for demonstration purposes as well.

A list of the programs and their function below. All programs are saved in the [`src`](./src) folder. BrainF files have the extension `.bf` while the same files minified have the extension `.min.bf`.

List of programs:
- [`hello.bf`](./hello.bf): Prints "Hello world!".
- `add.bf`: Adds the numbers in the first two cells without altering them, and puts the result in the third cell. The fourth cell will be used but left as 0 after operation.
- `sub.bf`: Same as `add.bf`

## PBrain Programs
Some programs use the PBrain extension language for procedure execution. These have `.bfs` extension.
